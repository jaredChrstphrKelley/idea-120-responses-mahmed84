Chris Salter, further talks about how space has been thought of within the framework of the theater, and how different kinds of materials are organized. Through this reading, we come to understand that the theater, as a kind of practice, is deeply technological and disciplinary. 
While there is a system of constraint, moving people through these spaces, we donâ€™t really tell them what to do or what role they are playing. 
In a theater, the inhibitor, the experiencers are actually changing the varying object that are encountering.
